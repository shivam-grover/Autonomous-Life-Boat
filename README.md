An autonomous life boat concept.

#Approach:

1. Detect humans (using a camera right now, would switch to heat dissipation values in the future for more accurate results)
2. Travel toward the body
3. Deploy pick up mechanism and pick the person up
Future prospects:
1. Find the nearest land/ship and move towards it
2. Send SOS alerts to nearby recievers
3. Collaboratively work with drones. Drones can be used to detect the bodies, since they're at a higher level and have a wider fielf of view. Then the coordinates of the body detected can be mapped and sent to the boat. The boat will travel to an approximate point near the body and then use the heat vision sensor for more accurately narrowing down the pick up point.

An autonomous life boat concept.

# **Approach:**

1. Detect humans (using a camera right now, would switch to heat dissipation values in the future for more accurate results)
2. Travel toward the body
3. Deploy pick up mechanism and pick the person up (currently a ramp controlled by a servo)

Future prospects:
1. Find the nearest land/ship and move towards it
2. Send SOS alerts to nearby recievers
3. Using thermal camera/ other heat vision devices for detection
4. Collaboratively work with drones. Drones can be used to detect the bodies, since they're at a higher level and have a wider fielf of view. Then the coordinates of the body detected can be mapped and sent to the boat. The boat will travel to an approximate point near the body and then use the heat vision sensor for more accurately narrowing down the pick up point.
5. Detect floods in coastal areas and water entering ships using water sensor and take necessary actions beforehand


Applications:
1. Can be used as lifeboats
2. Can beused in rescue missions and regular search parties
3. Can be used during floods
